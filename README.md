# FastSearchResolver

Tired of waiting for duckduckgo to resolve your !bang searches?

Self host the resolver and don't care about it anymore

run/deploy the application and paste the result as your new search engine i.e. `http://localhost:8080?q=%s` and you'll be able to use any "bang-operator" from duckduckgo.
